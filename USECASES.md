Eric is our end user.  Eric doesn't know any Python.  He wants to see Python in
his browser as much as he wants to see PHP in his browser.

Paula is our Pythonista.  Paula isn't a web developer, or even an app
developer, but she loves IPython Notebooks and creates ones that she would like
to be able to share as "graphical scripts" with her colleagues, like Eric.
Those colleagues want to run them but not have to look at or touch any code.

  required to run the notebook `Power Series.ipynb`
